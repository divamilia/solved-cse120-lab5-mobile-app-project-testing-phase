The Software Engineering course covers techniques for dealing with the complexity of software systems. We will focus on the technology of software engineering for the individual and small team, rather than business or management issues. The Mobile App project aims to provide an opportunity for students to analyze, design, develop, and deploy a mobile app based on Software Engineering methods that can introduce a new mobile service to the class, UC Merced community as well as worldwide users. By end of this lab, you will be able to define different testing scenarios for your mobile app.

<h1>Direction</h1>

This phase of project aims to improve the quality of a software project (your mobile app) in different test strategy scenarios based on <em>Regression test. </em>Each time you test a software application and find a bug, you have to repeat the test if it is a valid test, or you may conduct a new test based on new debugging and new development. The test strategy scenarios are as follow:

<ul>

 <li><strong>Internal test</strong>: You will test internal functions which are not visible to consumers. For instance, database connection, and queries.</li>

 <li><strong>Unit test</strong>: This test considers visible functions to consumers. For instance, “Sign up” or “Search” functions.</li>

 <li><strong>Application test</strong>: This test verifies all scenarios have been completed. This test enables you to find possible bugs in your software project.</li>

 <li><strong>Stress test</strong>: This test runs the software application in a stressful environment. For example, you may run your mobile app with limited network bandwidth or limited accessing to a cell phone resources, such as using the app when the SD memory is full.</li>

</ul>

Run all registration tests until you cannot find any bug in your mobile app.
